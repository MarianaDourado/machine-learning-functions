def costFunctionReg(theta, X, y, lambda_):
    """
    Compute cost and gradient for logistic regression with regularization.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    theta : array_like
        Logistic regression parameters. A vector with shape (n, ). n is 
        the number of features including any intercept. If we have mapped
        our initial features into polynomial features, then n is the total 
        number of polynomial features. 
    
    X : array_like
        The data set with shape (m x n). m is the number of examples, and
        n is the number of features (after feature mapping).
    
    y : array_like
        The data labels. A vector with shape (m, ).
    
    lambda_ : float
        The regularization parameter. 
    
    Returns
    -------
    J : float
        The computed value for the regularized cost function. 
    
    grad : array_like
        A vector of shape (n, ) which is the gradient of the cost
        function with respect to theta, at the current values of theta.
    
    Instructions
    ------------
    Compute the cost `J` of a particular choice of theta.
    Compute the partial derivatives and set `grad` to the partial
    derivatives of the cost w.r.t. each parameter in theta.
